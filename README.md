# DAT511-SmartBin
This project is called ‘Smart bin for Smart city’ which uses the Arduino distance sensor and GPS tracker to measure the waste levels of bins. This data will be visually presented on a map. That will show the colour icons of the bin levels. The traditional way of manually monitoring the wastes in waste bins takes a huge amount of human effort, time and cost. This can easily be avoided with this new concept of a 'Smart bin for Smart city’ project.
